===Habermas===
He is sincere in my perspective when I'm getting familiar with philosophy after I met it(or formally think about topics more like "philosophical" ones). But now I feel that Rorty have views that can really challenge Habermas on the positioning of philosophy, just like that Habermas say frankly that McCarthy thinks so directly(sharply) following the same topic(evidence?) as him that he must think the thing over again.

Born @ Vienna.
Seems quite strong security in heart.
